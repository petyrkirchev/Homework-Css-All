            <h4 class="task5">Improving an XML feed display through CSS and XSLT</h4>
            <p>XML feeds, though useful, are boring to look at in a browser because they are simple XML files. It's possible though to make
            them easier on the eye, and in this article we'll look at two ways of doing that. First, we'll use simple CSS
            properties to format each XML node, and then we'll use a little more complex but much more powerful XSL transformation.</p>.

            <p>While it may be relatively easy to create an incrementing and unique identifier inside a table in SQL Server, things get
            tricky with Oracle. In this article, we'll see the differences between the two databases and offer a way of solving
            the problem.</p>

            <h4 class="task5">Exporting word files to HTML</h4>
            <p>In this article we will first discuss the case for and against using Word as your HTML editor. Then we will see how to properly
            save a Word file to smaller, more compact HTML files. Third and last, we will see how to do this through code,
            and possibly create a batch process for converting numerous Word files to HTML at once.</p>
